# Course Database

First project from my COSC220 class. Simulates a university course database. Reads in data from a courseData.dat file, or a file passed from the command line, and copies this data into a made-from-scratch linked list. Once the data is copied, the user is presented with a menu of options. These options being: insert a new course, modify an existing course, delete an existing course, retrieve course data, and print course catalogue. 

Once the user has completed their work on the "database," the changes they've made are written to the original data file; overwriting the previous data.
